# BonkBot
Discord bot made to enhance your roleplay experience ðŸŽ‰

Disclaimer: this bot (as for current state) is meant to be used with another general-purpose bot (such as [Carl](https://carl.gg/)). I simply added some features that I felt were lacking and stated, that wouldn't be added in the future by the developer. Most of them are designed for a roleplay server.

## Features for users:
* Create comments (temp messages) by starting them with "//"
* Type in temporary channels (messages will be deleted after 24h)
* Claim specific channel by typing in them
* Climb in the leaderboard by posting longer responses in threads

## Features for admins:
* Purge messages in the channel from newest to specific message ID (excluding them)
* Check last response by the player's character in the thread
* Move channel to a specific category in alphabetic order

## Installing
You will need [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installing), and [Discord Bot API key](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
After that, simply navigate to bot directory, fill settings.json with proper information and run bot by running the command:
>python bot.py

Keep in mind, that bot will run as long as the command window is open, so you might want to host in on a remote server.
