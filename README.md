# BonkBot
Discord bot made to enchance your roleplay experience ðŸŽ‰


Disclaimer: this bot (as for current state) is meant to be used with other general-purpose bot (such as [Carl](https://carl.gg)). I simply added some features that I felt were lacking and stated, that wouldn't be added in the future by developer. Most of them are designed for roleplay server.

## Fearutes for users:
* Create comments (temp messages) by starting them with "//"
* Type in temporary channels (messages will be deleted after 24h)
* Claim spacific channel by typing in them
* Climb in leaderboard by posting longer responses in threads

## Features for admins:
* Purge messages in channel from newest to specifig message ID (excluding them)
* Check last response by player's character in thread
* Move channel to specific category in alphabetic order

## Installing 
You will need [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installing) and [Discord Bot API key](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

After that, simply navigate to bot directory, fill settings.json with proper informations and run bot by running command:

    python bot.py


Keep in mind, that bot will run as long as command window is open, so you might want to host in on remote server.
